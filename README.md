## Highlights

- OpenAI-compatible model: inherited
- Anthropic model: inherited
- Gemini model: inherited
- MCP client: native (C# shared runtime)
- Harmovela sink: inherited
- OpenTelemetry sink: inherited
- Subagent delegation: native (synchronous wrapper)
- Retriever: inherited (wrapper)

## Quick start

Install the published package:

```powershell
Install-Module praxo-core-ps
```

```powershell
$model = New-PraxoStaticModel -Content 'hello'
$options = New-PraxoAgentOptions -Model $model
$agent = New-PraxoAgent -Options $options
$session = New-PraxoSession -Id 'demo'
(Invoke-PraxoAgent -Agent $agent -Session $session -Prompt 'hello').Output
```

See the [full PowerShell README](language/powershell/README.md) for complete installation, build, and verification commands.

## What's included

| Capability | Status | Detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI-compatible model | inherited | Uses the C# Core |
| Anthropic model | inherited | Uses the C# Core |
| Gemini model | inherited | Uses the C# Core |
| MCP client | native (C# shared runtime) | `Connect-PraxoMcp`, `Get-PraxoMcpTools`, `Invoke-PraxoMcpTool`; wraps the C# MCP client and stdio/Streamable HTTP transports |
| Harmovela sink | inherited | Uses the C# Core |
| OpenTelemetry sink | inherited | Uses the C# Core |
| Subagent delegation | native (synchronous wrapper) | Reuses C# request/result/task types; no asynchronous manager |
| Retriever | inherited (wrapper) | Wraps C# `Retriever` |

## Examples

Runnable examples live under [`language/powershell/examples`](language/powershell/examples).

| Example | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| [checkpoint](language/powershell/examples/checkpoint) | This example uses the PowerShell Core checkpoint allowlist for a registered payload round trip. |
| [event-sink](language/powershell/examples/event-sink) | This example demonstrates event fan-out and tool-only filtering with PowerShell-friendly sink collections. |
| [identity-policy](language/powershell/examples/identity-policy) | This example binds a trusted principal to policy decisions and rejects missing, role-mismatched, and tenant-mismatched actions. |
| [mcp](language/powershell/examples/mcp) | The PowerShell Core does not bundle an MCP client. This example provides a transport-neutral MCP-shaped client boundary: initialize, `tools/list`, and `tools/call` over a caller... |
| [provider-fallback](language/powershell/examples/provider-fallback) | This example calls a fallback only after the primary fails and preserves the primary failure when both fail. |
| [retry](language/powershell/examples/retry) | This example retries a transient failure with a bounded attempt count and keeps the exhausted failure state. |
| [service](language/powershell/examples/service) | This example defines a transport-neutral request handler with health, principal, and run cases. |
| [streaming](language/powershell/examples/streaming) | This example accumulates streamed chunks and checks that they reconstruct the final output. |
| [structured-output](language/powershell/examples/structured-output) | This example validates a final JSON answer against a schema and rejects invalid output. |

## Verify

Run the checks from `language/powershell`:

```bash
dotnet build language/csharp/Praxo.Core/Praxo.Core.csproj -c Release
dotnet run --project language/csharp/Praxo.Conformance -c Release
dotnet run --project language/csharp/Praxo.Tests -c Release
pwsh -NoProfile -File language/powershell/tests/run.ps1
pwsh -NoProfile -File language/powershell/api-snapshot.ps1 -Check
```

This mirror contains the language source and the shared `spec/` vectors, so the implementation can be built and tested here. See [`language/powershell/README.md`](language/powershell/README.md) for the exact commands. The monorepo CI runs conformance, API snapshot, and native tests for this implementation.
